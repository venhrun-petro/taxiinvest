            ## Farmed fish is **not the only solution**

            Poor fish farming practices car cause pollution of surrounding waters and use products that may contain chemicals and antibiotics.
        warning: Many farmed fish such as grouper and salmon are fed with other wild caught fish

  #      ### Collection & Reproduction
  #      ##### Catching & Spawning Adults

  #      Adult fish are trapped in cages and transferred to special tanks on board the ship and spawn naturally. Every viable egg is fertilized, developing into juveniles feed a high energy diet free from microplastics.

  #     ### In the Wild
  #     ##### Death from microplastics

  #     Wild spawned juveniles in early development sometimes eat microplastic before they have a fully developed stomach and die.  Sea Life Rescue solves this problem by first feeding nutrient-rich foods to ensure the juveniles have the best energy reserves to develop a fully functioning digestive system before being released.

  #     ### On the ship
  #     ##### Feeding & Release

  #     Thanks to the first feeding of nutrient rich food the juveniles have a fully developed stomach to pass through any microplastic they eat in the wild. Then they get released into nursery protected areas which have sea grass, weed beads, rocks and coral reefs for the juviniles to contine to grow into healthy fish.

    items:
      - text: Wastewater from sewage and agriculture adds excess phosphates and nitrogen which stimulate blooms of noxious and toxic algae in coastal ecosystems.
      - text: Excess algae growth decomposes with aerobic bacteria causing hypoxic (oxygen-depleted) Dead Zones leading to eutrophication causing animals to die.
      - text: Dead Zones result in biodiversity collapse, major economic losses for coastal fishing industries, and release of (NOX) nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300x more powerful than CO2.
  - block: block-9
    img: img/block-9.webp

      Dead Zones can be prevented by rejuvenating the natural filter-feeding bivalves which consume the algae blooms, improving water clarity and reducing nutrients preventing oxygen-deficient dead zones from forming along coastal regions, as well as providing a sustainable benefit to the fishing industry.
